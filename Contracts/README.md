<h3 align="center"> Brief introduction </h3>
 <p>The main goal of the work is a implementation of a smart contract by showcasing a sample agreement between two parties using Solidity code<br><br>
The scientific novelty of the work lies in the fact that a new approach to the interaction of the patient with doctors is proposed.</p>
    <h4 align="center">Blockchain</h4>
    <p align="justify">When a medical record is generated and signed, it can be recorded in the blockchain, which gives patients proof and confidence that the record cannot be changed. These personal medical records can be encoded and stored on the blockchain using a private key so that they are accessible only to certain individuals, thereby ensuring confidentiality.</p>
    <h4 align="center">Smart Contract</h4>
    <p align="justify">Smart contracts can make data accessible and transparent to both patients and doctors by working as a gatekeeper who manages who is given access to information. </p>
